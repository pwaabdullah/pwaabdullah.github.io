**Short**

Currently, as an LLM Architect, helping Aisera build a LLM foundational model and fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLM reasoning models to automate enterprise solutions. 

Previously, as an MLE at Meta, I worked on ads ranking, advertiser automation, and personalized shopping ads, using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and tools. I am part of the Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns Ranking Team, where I contribute to optimizing the ad delivery and performance for Billions of users and advertisers worldwide. Besides, I got a chance to work on Meta's largest open-source LLM's library Llama as a part of the Gen AI collaboration. 

I have a strong academic background in computer science, with a PhD from Florida International University and a Master's degree from King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals. During my PhD, I developed a drug recommendation system and a feature selection framework for high dimensional data, using Deeplearning4j and TensorFlow. I also have multiple certifications in cloud computing and machine learning from reputable institutions. I am passionate about applying my skills and knowledge to solve real-world problems and create a positive social impact.
